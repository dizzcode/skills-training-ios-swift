// #01 : Variables and Constants
//Variables can change their values.
var name = "Shavinda"
name = "Max"
print(name)

//Constants cannot change once they are set.
let age = 30
// age = 30  // This will cause an error because 'age' is a constant

print("\(name) \(age)")

// #02 : Data Types
//Swift is type-safe, meaning that it requires you to be explicit about the types of values your code can work with.

var greeting: String = "Hello, World!"
var year: Int = 2024
var isSwiftFun: Bool = true
let pi: Double = 3.14159
print(pi)
